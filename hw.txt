CIS 532 students: email <javid@cs.uoregon.edu>, with the subject "CIS 532: Program 2 Submission".

[What to submit]  You need to submit your source code and a README file describing
               how to compile and run it on ix.cs.uoregon.edu.  Then your program
               will be tested on ix.  Make sure you README is easy to follow but
               not too verbose/tedious.
               
===========

Implementing a Reliable Transport Protocol
In this laboratory programming assignment, you will be writing the sending and
receiving transport-level code for implementing a simple reliable data transfer protocol.
There are two versions of this lab, the alternating-bit-protocol version and the
GBN version. This lab should be fun—your implementation will differ very little
from what would be required in a real-world situation.
Since you probably don’t have standalone machines (with an OS that you can
modify), your code will have to execute in a simulated hardware/software environment.
However, the programming interface provided to your routines—the
code that would call your entities from above and from below—is very close to
what is done in an actual UNIX environment. (Indeed, the software interfaces
described in this programming assignment are much more realistic than the infinite
loop senders and receivers that many texts describe.) Stopping and starting
timers are also simulated, and timer interrupts will cause your timer handling routine
to be activated.
The full lab assignment, as well as code you will need to compile with your
own code, are available at this book’s Web site: http://www.awl.com/kurose-ross.
